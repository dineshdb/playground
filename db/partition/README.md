## Getting started

`just partitioned` or `just non-partitoned` to run partitioned and non-partitioned resp.

This command will setup the database and run your queries through partitioned
and non-partitioned tables.

This is by no means a proper benchmark because it doesn't account for many
things. It is just a quick and dirty playground.
